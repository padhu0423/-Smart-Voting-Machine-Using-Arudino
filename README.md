# -Smart-Voting-Machine-Using-Arudino
This project presents a Smart Voting Machine using Arduino, aimed at enhancing the transparency, efficiency, and security of the electoral process. The system is built using an Arduino Uno board integrated with components such as an LCD display, push buttons, LEDs, and a fingerprint sensor to provide a reliable and tamper-proof voting mechanism. Voters can cast their votes by pressing dedicated buttons for each party, and the result is instantly calculated and displayed. Additional features such as biometric verification and visual indicators (LEDs) ensure authenticity and user feedback. The machine is designed to be user-friendly and cost-effective, making it suitable for small-scale elections such as in schools, colleges, and local organizations. The project demonstrates the practical application of embedded systems in automating democratic processes, reducing manual errors, and preventing multiple voting or fraud.
